## üìå Project Overview

Blue Bank, a U.S.-based financial institution, faced challenges due to a lack of reporting on borrower risk. With limited staff in the loan department, they needed an automated solution to analyze borrower profiles and flag potential risks.

This dashboard provides a **comprehensive overview** of:
- Credit utilization,
- Debt-to-income ratio,
- FICO scores,
- Loan distribution by income,
- and more.

## üéØ Goals

- Visualize loan distribution across key metrics.
- Help staff identify **risky borrowers** using credit utilization and FICO score analysis.
- Enable quick filtering by income group and interest rate types.
- Deliver an **interactive dashboard** with dynamic filters using Tableau.
